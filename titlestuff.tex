\begin{abstract}

  This report considers the automatic REM observations taken by the Red Dots
  Project of three {\rdwarf} objects, specifically \prox, {\bstar} and Ross 154,
  with particular attention to \bstar. The available data is considered and an
  analysis of the likely precision of measurements suitable for further analysis
  assessed.
